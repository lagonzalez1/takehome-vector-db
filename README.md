## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a REST API that allows users to **index** and **query** their documents within a Vector Database.

 A Vector Database specializes in storing and indexing vector embeddings, enabling fast retrieval and similarity searches. This capability is crucial for applications involving natural language processing, recommendation systems, and many moreâ€¦

The REST API should be containerized in a Docker container.

### Definitions

To ensure a clear understanding, let's define some key concepts:

1. Chunk: A chunk is a piece of text with an associated embedding and metadata.
2. Document: A document is made out of multiple chunks, it also contains metadata.
3. Library: A library is made out of a list of documents and can also contain other metadata.

The API should:

1. Allow the users to create, read, update, and delete libraries.
2. Allow the users to create, read, update and delete chunks within a library.
3. Index the contents of a library.
4. Do **k-Nearest Neighbor vector search** over the selected library with a given embedding query.

### How to run
1. Git clone this repo
2. Open terminal and navigare /app/Dockerfile
3. Shell command (build the docker iamge): docker build -t vector-takehome .
4. Shell command (run the container): docker run -p 8000:8000 vector-takehome
5. Using postman the following endpoints are available ...

POST: /create_library
GET: /libraries
POST: /update_library
POST: /create_chunk
POST: /update_chunk
POST: /delete_chunk
POST: /index_hash
POST: /index_tree
POST: /search_hash
POST: /search_tree


### Solution

The indexing algorithms i choose are Hashmap (brute force), KD-Tree and finally VP Tree
